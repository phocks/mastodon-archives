OK so this all should be set up correctly (I hope) after Oracle screwed me
over. I did what I probably should have done in the first place. Set up a web
domain ([https://ms.phocks.org](https://ms.phocks.org)) and am redirecting it
to my local domain, so I'm discoverable as

My first reading of Frank Herbert's “Dune” was in 1969, and I couldn't
convince anyone else to read it, mostly because the reviews weren't that good.

When others did come around to reading it, the message they got from the book
was the opposite of mine, which is a cautionary tale warning of unfettered
capitalistic extraction, exploitation-based cultures and the fanatical belief
in strongmen, messianic figures.

So, I’ve had two good pieces of news for the ActivityPub book from O’Reilly
Media. The first one is that I finished the 6th of 7 chapters this week (on
using and creating ActivityPub extensions). It was a gruelling chapter that I
had to reorganise a couple of times to clarify, but I’m so happy that it’s in
the can.

The second big piece of news is that the first two chapters of the
[ActivityPub
book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/activitypub/9781098162733/) are up
for early access review on O’Reilly Media’s Learning Platform. This is a big
deal for me — people have started reading and interacting with the book in the
real world. Mind blown!

If you are interested in ActivityPub, and you have access to the O’Reilly
Media Learning Platform, I would take it as a _big favour_ if you would read
what’s available now (Introduction, ActivityPub API) and give me your
feedback.

Two more chapters should be available soon — Activity Stream 2.0, and the
federation protocol — I’ll post here when I’ve got more news.

Thanks to everyone who’s been helpful or supportive in this process. I’m
looking forward to the full availability of this book in the coming months.

These are words rather than deeds, and in my opinion nowhere near enough, but
he will likely be attacked by the media, Republicans, and even some Democrats
just for CRITICIZING genocide.

This is why Bernie is the most hated politician in Washington DC.

“The real struggle in being vegan doesn’t involve food. The hardest part about
being vegan is coming face-to-face with the darker side of humanity and trying
to remain hopeful. It’s trying to understand why otherwise good and caring
people continue to participate in the needless violence against animals just
for the sake of their own pleasure or convenience.”

The cybertruck is a rare look directly into what Elon thinks and does not
think are reasonable things car owners have to deal with

Reasonable:  
\- gunshots (NOT AT THE GLASS!)  
\- using it as a boat  
\- high speed crashes where you want the car to survive not the driver or any
pedestrians

Unreasonable:  
\- rain  
\- puddle on the road  
\- off-road (can cars even do that??)  
\- dirt your maid--specifically the garage maid--hasn't cleaned off yet  
-regulations in general

This is a cool video with lots of excellent charts, but I'll also save you a
click and some time by answering the title question "How did Australia's
housing market get so bad, and is it all negative gearing's fault?". It was
all John Howard's fault, by halving capital gains tax, thus incentivising
negative gearing and housing as an investment instead of housing to house
people. Screw that dude and anyone who voted for him lol.

If you’re an open-source project maintainer, and somebody starts getting on

strike on
[#WorldCentralKitchen](https://mastodon.social/tags/WorldCentralKitchen)
vehicles leave absolutely ZERO room for doubt:
[#Israel](https://mastodon.social/tags/Israel) deliberately targeted the aid
agency in [#Gaza](https://mastodon.social/tags/Gaza). The clearly marked
vehicles were spread out over a 1.5 mile route previously agreed with the IDF.
They were targeted in succession, as passengers from the first vehicle were
fleeing to the 2nd, then 3rd vehicle. These things don't happen by 'mistake'
as [#Netanyahu](https://mastodon.social/tags/Netanyahu) pretends with a smile.

Have to give Israel credit. They're getting exactly what they wanted. Shoot up
aid workers so every other aid agency gets the hint and pulls out.

The only question is if the world will tolerate this. If the West does
nothing, they are sending the signal that there is no moral high ground, only
higher fire power.

You can win the war but even as far back as Confucius we knew that was not a
path to stability.

Off-topic, but because a few people have been shocked when I’ve mentioned it
lately, just a note that Schwartz Media outlets - including the Saturday Paper
- have long been under boycott for their erasure of Palestinian people (the
owners are strongly pro-Israel):

> The Schwartz Media group has faced accusations of supporting Zionism and
> Israel, and of avoiding critical discussion of both, as ABC journalist [John
> Lyons](https://www.smh.com.au/national/touchy-subject-we-must-end-self-
> censorship-on-israel-and-palestine-20210909-p58qco.html) has written.
> Indeed, as [Randa Abdel-Fattah has
> observed](https://meanjin.com.au/blog/lobbied-the-palestinian-erasure/),
> Schwartz Media “has what seems almost a policy position of [avoiding
> coverage of Israel](https://overland.org.au/2014/08/palestine-and-the-
> saturday-paper/) (and not publishing Palestinians, let alone Palestinians
> critical of Israel)”.
>
> The company is currently under boycott from Palestinian and other writers in
> solidarity, including many First Nations writers, because of this continued
> work of erasure. Projects like [The Sunday
> Paper](https://thepalestineproject.medium.com/the-sunday-paper-uncensored-
> indigenous-voices-16a4b7c78a67) — in contrast to the Schwartz-owned The
> Saturday Paper — have arisen to highlight this and to build alternative
> spaces for political discussions around indigeneity and solidarity.

"From this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of any particular
interest. But for us, it's different. Consider again that dot. That's here.
That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone
you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The
aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions,
ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and
coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant,
every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor
and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every
"superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of
our species lived there – on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of
blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and
triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think
of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this
pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how
frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how
fervent their hatreds.

Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some
privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale
light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In
our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from
elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere
else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit,
yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we
make our stand.

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building
experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human
conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our
responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and
cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known."

Every time I do tech support for my family I get very angry about people who
whine about lacking "tech literacy".

90% of the stuff I have to teach them is how to navigate manipulative software
and dark patterns. This has nothing to do with tech, but with capitalism. Tech
is not complicated, it is just made maximally confusing on purpose to remove
agency.

Better tech ed won't fix this.

"A handful of sand contains about 10,000 grains, more than the number of stars
we can see with the naked eye on a clear night. But the number of stars we can
see is only the tiniest fraction of the number of stars that are. What we see
at night is the merest smattering of the nearest stars. Meanwhile the Cosmos
is rich beyond measure: the total number of stars in the universe is greater
than all the grains of sand on all the beaches of the planet Earth."

The whole model of taxing "income" is wrong. We need to tax Wealth, not
Income. Because the ones who desperately need taxing aren't the working folk.

Incidentally, in Canada there is a tax rebate called the "Canada Workers
Benefit" (previously "Working Income Tax Benefit") which returns several
thousand dollars to those within the bracket. It's a tiny band-aid step in the
right direction, to lighten the tax load on those who are working for it, but
the whole system needs to change.

People love to applaud civil rights, anti-war, and anti-apartheid protests of
the past, and say that they can't believe that people opposed them back then.
Yet at the same time they see no problem attacking people protesting for human

Part of what makes tech bro libertarians’ politics so uniquely toxic is the
bottomless well of rage they seem to feel at the very idea that they might
have any obligation of care to other living beings. Republicans are racist,
sexist, committed to a theocratic death cult, sure. But they at least
acknowledge some form of responsibility to a broader social unit, the family,
the church, the race. Tech bros really want a world of fully atomized
individuals with no social relationship except that which can be mediated by
capital, and they really think this would be a position of power rather than
one of abject degradation.

In 2014, white supremacist were in an armed stand-off with federal police.
Literally having guns pointed at each other

You would assume this would have led to arrests or punishment of some sort?

Nope, they were all allowed to leave, and no one was ever punished

Remember Damn Small Linux, Chooms? It's back again, revived and ready for
2024! :xenialinux:

To celebrate, I pulled out an old Asus Eee PC 701 4G and installed it! Out of
the box, everything works!

Instead of the old aim of what could be crammed into a 50MB distro, the new
DSL instead aims for a more reasonably comfy 700MB limit; essentially a normal
CD size! It's based off the antiX distro, just more scaled back and smaller to
fit within the 700MB limit.

Give it a shot if you have old hardware laying around that needs an OS!

Forced cashless society.

Our nearby small market town used to have 3 banks; they're all closed (taking
their cash machines with them), and this week one of the two remaining cash
machines was removed from the supermarket where it was located.

So, we're down to a single cash machine in an area with a radius (I'm
guessing) of around 20 miles.

The cashless society doesn't represent consumer choice, its pace is being
forced by financial institutions keen to charge fees on transactions!

I continue to be fascinated by the fact that when Jack Dorsey looks back at
his time at Twitter, his only regret is that it was technically possible for
him to ban the Nazis so people nagged him to do so.

So now his ideal social network is one where the moderators can’t ban Nazis.

So…there is a concerted campaign, with Musk as its mouthpiece, to discredit
Signal and get people to switch to Telegram. It’s disinformation, but there’s
also useful information in it. The useful information is that a hideous,
powerful, right-wing crank — or whoever’s yanking his chain — really, really
wants people to use Telegram.

We’ve long known Telegram’s security is weak. But now, in light of this new
information, we should move forward assuming that Telegram is actively
compromised.

There is a weird talking point about

against killing people without understanding the nuances of the history.

When [#Hamas](https://social.linux.pizza/tags/Hamas) attacked in October, no
one said that you couldn't condemn those killings unless you had a deep
understanding of history.

Knowing history is good but you don't actually have to know everything to

solution lies not in technological fixes, but in a fundamental change in human

necessary.

MS have done it again and people are looking for a way out.

DON'T TREAT NEWBIES LIKE SHIT.

SEARCH FOR, OR HOW TO INTERPRET THE RESULTS THEY'D FIND.

Urge to [#Linux](https://glasgow.social/tags/Linux) again… rising. It’s a big
“nope” from me with Microsoft Recall.

I had an abortive attempt with Arch then Ubuntu over Christmas, they were both
great, and free from creeping AI and enshittification of Windows.

The hurdles I wasn’t able to overcome were all audio production related.
Struggled to find ASIO drivers for my Behringer interface, so realtime
monitoring wasn’t happening and annoyingly essential programs like Native
Access were an enormous hassle.

Any advice welcome!

It's finally time: DARK WIRE, my book on how the FBI secretly ran its own tech
startup to wiretap the world, is out *today*. Here is WIRED's adaption of that
story following the craziest character I've ever investigated: a drug
trafficker called Microsoft.

Microsoft was someone who orchestrated twilight drops of cocaine in the ocean,
and a seemingly infinite number of other drug trafficking schemes. Because of
his high-risk work, he turned to encrypted phones. Soon, he came into contact
with one in particular, called Anom.

Microsoft didn't just want to use Anom. He wanted to sell the phones, and
eventually take over the company from the inside. This is his story, about
crime, faith, and trust in technology.

Jury finds three Just Stop Oil petrol pump protestors not guilty despite all
their legal defences being ruled out. A unanimous Not Guilty verdict was
returned.  
  
They were charged with £190,000 of damage and loss of earnings for
decommissioning petrol pumps in April 2022.  
  
Some say this is astonishing.  
  
It's not really. It is called jury equity.  
  
Any jury may consider that the law itself is unjust. It is an important
principle and indicates public opposition to aspects of law, in this case, the
'lawful' behaviour of fossil fuel corporations.

how to answer this question. In the meantime, try Google Search") and with
Microsoft's Copilot ("It might be time to move onto a new topic.") Dear

Please DO NOT go around throwing birds (including swifts) you find on the
ground up into the air!

A bird on the ground that can't get away from you is in distress*. Put it in a
quiet, safe place (a closed paper bag or cardboard box w/ a paper towel is
ideal) and contact a wildlife rehabilitator for advice.

SOURCE: I've been doing bird and wildlife rescue for nearly a decade.

*The exception here may be fledglings in spring/summer. Call a wildlife rehab if you're not sure.

Belgium has become the first European country to decriminalise sex work and
this has opened the door to worker's rights for sex workers such as pensions,
maternity cover, health insurance and social welfare. We must decriminalise
sex work in Ireland!

It's my birthday. As usual I'm donating to HSI to stop this horror. (2x

China’s notorious Yulin dog and cat meat “festival” begins on June 21. Every
year, thousands of stolen family pets or strays are packed tightly into small,
painful wire cages, trembling in fear. They are transported for days in the
relentless summer heat. Those who survive the journey will be beaten and
brutally slaughtered for their meat. Please donate to help animals worldwide.

Hey fyi

You can go to radiooooo.com (that's 5 o's), look at the world map, select a
country, select a decade, and then listen to music from that time and place.
For free. No ads. No idea how or why but it exists. Check it out!

Edit: you should also know that radio.garden gives access to currently airing
radio stations. I am not familiar, but several people have endorsed it. Nice
to have options!

Last edit, promise.

P.S. Hearthis.at and Mixcloud.com if you're interested in following DJs &
listening to their mixes. Both pros and amateurs.

The irony is not lost on me that the Internet Archive went out of its way to
acquire the physical versions of millions of books and loan them out carefully
and in a limited way, and is facing a near-extinction-level event over it,
while for-profit and VC-backed companies are just stealing people’s content
and making up excuses to validate the bad behavior.

Solarpunk isn't supposed to be about "Silicon Valley futurism but with solar
panels and wind turbines."

Solarpunk is about how computers are hewn from stone, how the Internet runs
through metal embedded in the Earth. Solarpunk is about robbing scrap from a
landfill and building a wind turbine out of the junk. Solarpunk is about your
home getting flooded and embracing your new identity as Swamp Town. Solarpunk
is about living in a hole like a hobbit, building the walls of your home out
of aeroponic gardens, and assaulting green deserts with wildflower seed bombs.

Solarpunk is about how "sufficiently advanced civilization is
indistinguishable from nature."

I grew up in public housing and never really expected to be in a position to
buy a house and I think it's absolutely hilarious that the moment I'm finally
settling down with a family and we're kind of in a position to start looking
at houses the pandemic and housing crisis comes along and prices us out of
every house in the city. Oh the tragic soul-crushing irony! Anyway I love my
job but if anyone knows of one that pays $175,440 like this article says I

Russia just blew up a children’s hospital in Kiev. But that’s okay the Russian
ambassador can get a good night sleep in his Canberra house. Maybe Albo can
find a spine and put him on a small row boat and point him and his staff out
of the Sydney heads. He can share the boat with the Israeli ambassador.

Linux's quality of life on an ordinary laptop is *embarrassing*.

Like, I'm able to use it. But it is embarrassing. No normal person would put
up with the garbage desktop Linux puts me through. I put up with it because

personally I think the MONA thing is hilarious, especially in the context of
the Discourse.  
  
for non-Australians, the Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) in Tasmania had an
area called the Ladies Lounge, where men were not allowed. They hung several
fake Picassos, an antique mink rug that was actually polyester, and a bunch of
fake tribal spears. The idea was that it was a criticism of the general idea
of the patriarchy where men typically have a lot more opportunities for...
pick a thing. Even when women were allowed in, what was actually inside were
cheap replicas devoid of any amount of authenticity. It's ripping on token
inclusion.  
  
In an eye-watering display of self-awareness deficiency, a man then sued MONA
for not being allowed in, claiming discrimination due to being a man. He
claimed that as he had paid admission to the whole of MONA but was not
permitted to this specific exhibit due to his gender, he was being
discriminated against.  
  
The Tasmanian Civil Tribunal agreed, and MONA was directed to admit men into a
women's-only area. The irony is thick enough that you could cut it with a
knife.  
  
MONA, in response, dismantled the exhibit except for the fake Picassos. All
the bathrooms at MONA are single-occupancy all-gender, but it turns out having
a women's bathroom from which men are excluded *isn't* discriminatory, so they
converted one into a women's bathroom and hung the fake Picassos in there, an
exhibit of itself.  
  
The art exhibit was basically a criticism of "turns out the only safe space
for women away from men is a bathroom, and people will still claim that you're
getting special rights because you get to see something nobody else can. Even
if what you're seeing is a cheap replica, someone somewhere will claim that
you have it good because you're getting something they don't."  
  
Picasso's estate, however, took a rather dim view of unauthorised replicas
being displayed in an art gallery in Tasmania, even though it was literally
years between putting up the artwork and someone noticing. They've since been
taken down with no further action.  
  
MONA has declared that the Ladies Lounge will return as something where S26 of
the Sex Discrimination Act doesn't apply, such as a church or boutique
glamping experience.  
  
They've also expressly stated that the Ladies Lounge includes ALL women, not
just cis ones.  
  
I love everything about this story. Fucking classic stuff coming out of the
art world.

A couple of things I've observed from the Rugrats demo:

\- Pressing Tab allows you to toggle between formats, a 16:9 zoomed in default
view, and a 4:3 zoomed out view. I prefer the latter; it avoids vertical
scrolling and gives a full viewport of the game.

\- There is a toggle in the settings that swaps between HD and 8-bit NES style
graphics. Graphics choice will come down to personal preference...BUT the
developer actually incorporated this version as a NES ROM; you can browse the
game directory and copy that ROM to your emulator or gaming device of choice.

Super cool. A game made with retro love. :)

update: i swapped to a different SATA cable and where before i was getting a
lowly 5MB/s read rate now i'm seeing 112MB/s read rate .. so perhaps it was
just a dodgy cable afterall. moral of the story is in a system with lots of
moving parts sometimes you never really know where the fail point is until you
investigate fully

The other point is the other end - whenever someone says "there is no
evidence", treat that as a HUGE red flag. So, scientifically, you have gone
and asked every single person in the world, and literally not a single person
has any evidence for that? Yeah, nah. In fact often it relates to something I
have direct experience with and I know there most definitely IS evidence.
These people have a view to push, and they want to convince you they're right
and not bother looking for yourself.

even violent ones, he implied that women should stay in violent marriages. It
doesn't take a sociology degree to know that it is women who are most victims

It's time I finally finish this rewatch of HBO's The Leftovers. It's pure
genius but these Australian episodes they do in Season 4 are slightly painful
to watch. Anyone else seen it all the way through? I don't think I've known
anyone else who's watched it.

"It’s not an easy watch, but in some ways, the difficulty of the show is what
is so rewarding about it—as if, finally, there is a show that understands how
awful it can feel to be a human being in the world."

**Chess hasn’t been updated in almost 200 years** and it’s obvious the devs
have abandoned it. The greedy creators took your money and laughed all the way
to the bank.

**I remember back in 705 AD when chess was fun**. Then they started adding
**stupid features** no one wanted like “castling” and “en passant” instead of
**listening to player feedback** and fixing **game-breaking bugs**. I’ve been
complaining for years about the collision-detection glitch with **the
horsey**. The ‘clipping-through-pieces’ bug has been abused to death and the
lazy devs refuse to **fix it**.

Don’t support this awful behaviour and **boycott this company**.

It’s one of those facts of the world that most people know but don’t really
want to know: Billions of animals on factory farms live their lives in
gruesome and torturous conditions so that our eggs and meat are a bit cheaper.
Virtually no one really approves of it, but almost everyone participates in
it.

If you want to change that, what should you do about it?
